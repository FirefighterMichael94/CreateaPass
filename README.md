# CreateaPass
This Repo has a password generator that we created got class
We were given starter code and a Criteria to complete.
This code was created by Me Michael And the help of resources online and in the class.
I could noot get my prompt to say yes or no so instead it says canel or yes
I was going to try and work with a custom prompt but it took me further away from the code. 
this code does what it is asked to do but could use changes to make it go past criteria 

criteria for project 
```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
